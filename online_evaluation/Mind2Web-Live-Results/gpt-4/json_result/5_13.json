The new depot will also allow the MTA to transition to a fully electric bus fleet, which will eliminate carbon emissions associated with diesel fuel exhaust, resulting in cleaner air for Queens residents.\n\nThe project will include a permanent art installation, funded through the MTA Arts & Design Percent for Art program. The selection of both artist and art medium is underway. More information about MTA Arts & Design can be found here.\nThe design of the new facility incorporates new sustainability components. The depot building will have a \u201cgreen roof,\u201d which will not only help clean the air and absorb stormwater, but also act a form of insulation and reduce the depot\u2019s energy use. The depot is being constructed in accordance with LEED certification standards, an accredited and globally recognized status of sustainability achievement in construction.\nThe design of the new bus depot will address residents\u2019 concerns about noise by erecting a sound-deadening barrier wall along 107th Avenue and another along 165th Street. The walls will shield residents from noise produced by bus depot operations as well as create a visual barrier from the depot itself.\u00a0\nTo achieve the MTA\u2019s goal of creating economic opportunity in the communities where construction projects take place, we are piloting our first-ever local hiring goals, striving to recruit 20% of the New York State workforce from neighborhoods in Southeast Queens. As of October 2023, the project was on its way to achieving its M/WBE and SDVOB targets, and in some categories the project has already surpassed them.\n\nSkanska, the project\u2019s contractor, employs an Outreach Coordinator whose job is to ensure best-faith efforts to contract with M/WBE and SDVOB firms for smaller contracts within the larger project. Skanska is also participating in events such as internship fairs and other community outreach events to provide opportunities for Jamaica, Queens residents.\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      Project phases\n    \n\n\n\n\n          \n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Jamaica Bus Depot project will take approximately four years (Q1 2023\u2013Q1 2027).

These monitoring devices have been placed at key points along Liberty Avenue, Merrick Boulevard, Tuskegee Airmen Way, 165th Street, and 107th Avenue.\n\nSkanska and subcontractors will operate equipment on site to minimize disturbances and use the quietest machinery whenever possible. All construction equipment onsite will have sound deadening/noise suppression devices and will incorporate the latest noise attenuation features to comply with contract requirements and government regulations. \u00a0\nMTA construction contract specifications require Skanska to prepare a Construction Noise Management Plan to comply with NYC Noise Code.\nWhile NYCDEP allows construction activities to take place between 7 a.m, and 6 p.m., the depot work hours are generally 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.\u00a0\nThe project team will provide advance notice to be provided for anything outside of regularly scheduled work.\nBaseline monitoring will occur after York College Plan approval.\nThere will be a noise monitor installed in York College Parking Lot.\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                                              \n                \n                  \n                    Dust mitigation and air quality\n                    \n                      \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Skanska will be responsible for maintaining dust control during construction. Dust control measures including wet suppression and physical barriers such as windscreens and tarps to reduce the amount of particulate matter emissions around the worksite.\u00a0\n\nAny public areas on the outskirts of the work zone that are affected by construction will be cleaned immediately by the Skanska team.\nIf visible dust enters a public area, the Skanska team will stop the work and immediately clean the area prior to resuming work.\nSkanska will maintain a clean work site throughout each shift and will perform routine cleaning at the end of each workday to limit the buildup of dust and debris.\nIn addition to dust mitigation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations require contractors place clearly visible signage about any potential hazards in the workplace to ensure workers take any necessary precautions before entering the contained worksite.\n\nNote: asbestos and silica warning signs have been installed as a safety precaution for workers and should not be a cause for concern for the general public outside the work zone.\n\n\n\nAbatement and proper precautions will take place before demolition of the current depot commences.\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                                              \n                \n                  \n                    Traffic\n                    \n                      \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \nBuses and bus routes will be maintained throughout construction.\nStreet work will be coordinated in advance with NYSDOT.\nThe community will be notified in advance regarding any changes to the planned temporary curb lane and reduction in the width of the sidewalks.\nConstruction vehicle movements will be spread throughout the day depending on stage of construction.\nAccess to businesses on Merrick Boulevard will be maintained and protected.\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                                                                  \n    \n    \n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      Weekly mitigation updates\n    \n\n\n\n\n      \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                \n                  \n                    2024\n                    \n                      \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            July 2024\n\nJuly 15-19, 2024\nJuly 8-12, 2024\nJuly 1-5, 2024\n\nJune 2024\n\nJune 24-28, 2024\nJune 17-21, 2024\nJune 10-14, 2024\nJune 3-7, 2024\n\nMay 2024\n\nMay 27-31, 2024\nMay 20-24, 2024\nMay 13-17, 2024\nMay 6-10, 2024\n\nApril 2024\n\nApril 29-May 3, 2024\nApril 22-26, 2024\nApril 15-19, 2024\nApril 1-5, 2024\n\nMarch 2024\n\nMarch 25-29, 2024\nMarch 18-22, 2024\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nFebruary 26-March 1, 2024\nFebruary 19-23, 2024\nFebruary 12-16, 2024\nFebruary 5-9, 2024\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nJanuary 29-February 2, 2024\nJanuary 22-26, 2024\nJanuary 15-19, 2024\nJanuary 8-12, 2024\nJanuary 1-5, 2024\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                                              \n                \n                  \n                    2023\n                    \n                      \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            December 2023\n\nDecember 25-29, 2023\nDecember 18-22, 2023\nDecember 11-15, 2023\nDecember 4-8, 2023\n\nNovember 2023\n\nNovember 27-December 2, 2023\nNovember 20-24, 2023\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                                                                  \n    \n    \n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      Community outreach\n    \n\n\n\n\n          \n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The MTA and its contractors remain in close communication with local residents and stakeholders throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle.
